## Introduction
The Smart Home App is a mobile application built using React Native (Expo) that allows users to remotely control various devices inside their homes, such as lights, fans, and other appliances. The app also provides features to automate the operation of these devices based on a schedule, as well as monitor indoor temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Additionally, users can view statistics related to temperature and humidity, track the activity history of devices,  and login or register an account.

**Available for both iOS and Android.**

## Installation
To install the Smart Home App, follow these steps:
- Download the Expo client app from the App Store or Google Play.
- Clone the repository from Github.
- Install dependencies using npm install.
- Start the application using expo start.

## Technology
The Smart Home App was built using a number of technologies, including:

- React Native Expo - a framework for building native mobile apps using React Native, which provides a variety of pre-built components and tools to simplify the development process.

- React Native Elements - a library of pre-built UI components for React Native, which simplifies the development of the app's user interface.

- Socket.IO - a library for building real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, which allows the app to receive and send data in real-time.

- Firebase - a cloud-based platform that provides various services for mobile and web applications, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. Firebase is used in the app for authentication and real-time database.

- MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) - a lightweight messaging protocol for IoT devices, which allows the app to communicate with IoT devices using publish-subscribe messaging.

- Adafruit.IO - a cloud-based service that provides a platform for IoT devices to publish and subscribe to data feeds, which allows the app to communicate with Adafruit.IO-compatible devices.
